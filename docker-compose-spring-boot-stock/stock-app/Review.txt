To support you in further improving your code we would like to provide you with the following feedback on your assignment:

Done

- Preferably try to catch all exceptions instead of using ControllerAdvice
- Stock entity is used as request object
- No request validation present
- 204 returned for stock not found instead of 404
- No proper error messages are returned when there is an error

TODO:

- using optional isPresent check instead of using map.().orElse
- Tests don't run standalone without separately spinning up MySQL instance
- Field injection is used instead of constructor injection
- tests contains lot of duplicate code
